### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sienna

Currently I'm a student in my last semester at Columbia University, and will graduate in May 2023 with a major in :electric_plug::zap: Electrical Engineering and a minor in :computer: Computer Science (hence the GitHub) :mortar_board::bowtie:.

I spent last summer interning as a System Development Engineer at AWS...

...more specifically, on the DynamoDB team.

After I graduate, I plan to return full-time at AWS. Some languages I know include Python, JavaScript, C, C++, and Java.
